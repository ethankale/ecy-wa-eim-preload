EIM
===

These area a set of R script(s) to perform automated checks of data formatted for submittal to EIM.

These scripts have been developed for internal Ecology use.  They are intended to be used by data coordinators
with broad experience in EIM business rules.  Using these scripts is not a substitute for QA/QC, nor is it a 
substitute for careful formatting of data to meet EIM rules.
